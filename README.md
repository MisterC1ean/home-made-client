## Home Made

A small project to practice with ReactJS. A DIY community where you can upload a project and its instructions along with photos to show someone else how to complete that project. Projects can be viewed and liked by other users. Basic CRUD function for your own projects

## Motivation

I love learning new things especially from other people via the internet. The resources out there are amazing if you know where to find them. This app is a nod to a site like instructables where users can share their skills with others who may be wanting to do the same things

## Short Video Walkthrough

( coming soon )

## Basic How To Use
1. Sign in to Login Page as existing user ( Name: Marcus pw: 1234 )
2. Home page contains project cards that are filterable by using the search in the nav bar. ( foltered by title )
3. View a project by clicking on the icon in the upper right corner of the card
4. Add a like ( or as many as five ) by clicking on the heart icon in the bottom part of the project card
5. Create a new Project by clicking the 'Plus' button in the top nav bar
6. Add a title and a display photo using the form; then start the project using the 'start project' button
7. Add steps using the 'add step' button and complete the form.
8. Save the step by clicking the save step button ( edit if you made a mistake and need to change; just make sure to save again )
9. After completing and saving all of your steps slick the 'save project' button at the bottom of the page to be brough your newly created project.
10. You can edit any project created by the user you are logged in as by navigating to the project show page and clicking on the 'edit project' button.

## Tech Stack 

Ruby on Rails as API for back end
React JS Front End
Material UI Components for simple styling

## Additional Features I Would Like to Add

OAuth, comments, categories/tags, notifications when another user likes on of your projects, react dropzone for file upload and preview.

## Running the Project
The front end ( home-made-client ) runs using npm start ( port 3000 )
The back end ( home-made-api ) runs using rails s -p 3001 ( port 3001 )

## Credits
This project was definitely inspired by Instructables.com and I owe their team a lot of credit for being able to view their site as a model for what I was trying to do. I am an avid supporter of local makers and DIY enthusiasts and I hope technology can help spread various craffts and hobbies to a wider audience.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
